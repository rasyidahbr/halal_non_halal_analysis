    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effective in Simple Ingredient Detection:** The model currently performs well in detecting straightforward ingredient lists. It efficiently identifies basic ingredients, demonstrating its effectiveness in simpler scenarios of ingredient analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Developments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Streamlining Phrase Recognition:** Instead of continually adding new phrases to the existing list, it would be more practical to develop an efficient module for removing unwanted phrases, leaving only the ingredient names for analysis. This approach ensures streamlined and effective extraction of ingredient information without the need for constant phrase additions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Analysis of Sub-Ingredients:** To better determine halal status, the model should be able to analyze not just main ingredients but also their sub-ingredients. A more detailed approach is required to understand the complexity of ingredient lists and their individual components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Refining Halal Status Determination:** Assessing whether an ingredient is halal involves understanding its source and how it's processed. Enhancing the model to incorporate external data on ingredient sourcing and processing will improve its ability to accurately classify halal status.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ongoing Model Improvement:** As food ingredients and manufacturing processes change, the model must evolve. Implementing a learning mechanism that allows the model to update its knowledge base with new information will ensure it stays accurate and relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incorporating User Feedback:** Introducing a feature for users to provide feedback directly through the application. A feedback button can be implemented for users to suggest improvements or report inaccuracies, enabling the model to adapt and evolve based on user experiences and insights.\n"
